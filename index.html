            <p align="left">Hi, welcome to my web profile. Here I've demonstarated my skills in web design that I have leared from the coding
                bootcamp at Univeristy of Texas in association with Trilogy education services. Check out my mad coding skills.
            </p>

            <p>
                I'm an avid gamer, even though my skills peaked with COD MW2 I try to keep up with the new kids. I'm admittedly not what
                I used to be on the sticks, but I dream one day of recapturing old glory. My dreams are shattered daily,
                but I persist. I would gladly settle for a solo win on fortnite. I truly believe that one day I will achieve
                this goal.
            </p>

            <p>
                I'm a typical american hero. I watch movies, sports, and try my best to get along with people. Although my philosopy has
                generally been somewhere between Office Space and Ferris Bueller, I am trying to turn my bad habits around
                and have success. Also, coding is fun.
